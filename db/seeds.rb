"In creole, 'konbit' means the act of community, and mizik means music. KB is a NYS 501(c)3 non profit that began shortly after the 2010 earthquake.

Mission statement:

-To harness the universal power of music to empower, educate, and uplift haitiâ€™s most vulnerable youth.
Konbit Mizik provides free production, video, and career management services to local, underground musical artists in Haiti

-To provide educational and vocational training workshops and lectures on professional skills, life skills, music, and academics

-To mobilize communities throughout Haiti with collective action to address local problems and uplift those least fortunate. At a minimum 75% or more of budget goes towards program services, and a 3rd party accountant in a multi-lingual office audits, reviews, and authorizes all expenses."
