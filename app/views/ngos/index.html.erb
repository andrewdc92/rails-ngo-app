  <h4>In the last 20 years, Haiti has experienced over 20 major natural disasters.</h4> <br>
  Flooding, hurricanes, cholera, and earthquakes have impeded communities' continual efforts to return to normalcy.<br>
  There were 10,257 civilian casualties over that 20 year time span, not including the 2010 earthquake.<br>
  The Haitian government reported the death toll to have surpassed 230,000 people after the second quake passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most international non-profits create a rallying cry around natural disasters to bootstrap donations, <br>
  but over time 3rd party analysis, along with investigative journalism, determined that many international non-profits were incredibly ineffective <br>
  in bringing meaningful changes to communities that were not understood by the employees who lacked the shared lived experience.
