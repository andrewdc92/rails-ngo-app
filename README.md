# Ede Men

Check out our app on <a href="https://ede-men.herokuapp.com/"> Heroku

## Objective
Our goal was to create an educational application that communicated Haiti's history and geographical relationship to natural disasters. We wanted to facilitate direct donations to local non-profits and NGOs with a proven track record instead of targeting large international non-profits like the Red Cross. There is a long case study initiated by ProPublica that communicates the lack of transparency and ineffectiveness displayed by the Red Cross after the devastating 2010 earthquake. We wanted to use Paypal as our integration because it's integrated all around the world and is a trusted name for secure financial transactions. Chartkick and lazy high charts were used for the data visualization.

## Technologies Used
-Ruby on Rails
-Foundation
-Paypal
-Twitter
-Google Analytics
-Chartkick (engine) + Lazy High Charts (visualization)

The front end and back end is built on Ruby on Rails, with Puma running Ruby's default server. We used Foundation for the front end framework and so that we could work off a grid system. It also made the nav bar more aesthetically pleasing, but the Foundation Helper gem could not be configured to match the most updated version of foundation (v6.0).


## User Stories <br>
You can learn more about our user stories on <a href="https://trello.com/b/5lrSva6s/ngo">Trello</a>.

As a donor, I want to be sign up.

As a donor, I want to log in/log out.

As a donor, I want to donate directly to selected non-profits,

As a donor, I want to view individual NGOs and an index of the NGOs.


## Wireframe
The wireframes were created on Adobe XD and in the database there is a many to many relationship between NGOs and donors. Donors cannot extract their donation history directly because it's securely stored in Paypal, however each transaction generates a receipt, a proof of transaction (the non-profit received it successfully), and the donor's Paypal account stores all transaction histories. In a future build out, we discussed the option of allowing users to favorite non profits if the scope of the app expands outside of Haiti.

## Control Flow

We made a new branch for each respective feature we built out. I made a MVP branch each time we did a full merge from my teammates branches and we did only committed to master after completing some major checkpoints. Master and mvp-v3.0 are both up to date as of 1:15 PST on 10/20/16.
